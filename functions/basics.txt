function is a reusable block of code used to perform a specific tasks

Purpose of functions :
    - Abstract code
    - Code reusability
    - Parameters vs Arguments
    - Syntax

Parameters vs Arguments
Parameters are variables in the function definition, while arguments are the values passed to the function when it's called.


* Variadic Parameters
 A way to pass a variable number of values of a specific type into a function

 * Defer 
 A defer statement in  go defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.
Defered functions run in last in first out order

 * Method 
 a method in programming is a block of code that performs a specific action and is defined as part of a class in Object-oriented programming


 * Callbacks
  passing a func into another func as an argument

  * Closure
   one scope enclosing another 
   variable declared in the outer scope are accessible in inner scope
   Closure helps us limit the scope of variables
