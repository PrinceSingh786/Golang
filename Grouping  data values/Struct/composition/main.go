// composition is simply embedding one struct type within another .
// The fields and methods of the embedded "inner" struct become accessible to the outer struct.
// The inner type is said to be Promoted to the outer type.
// In go you don't create classes , you create  a type
// You don't instantiate , you create a value of a type
