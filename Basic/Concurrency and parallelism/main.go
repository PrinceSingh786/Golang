//Concurrency means code has the potential ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, where each task may make progress independently of the others.
/* In Go , we use goroutines,lightweight threads of execution that are managed by the Go runtime.
   A go program can create many goroutines that run concurrently , each performing a different task.package main
   The communication and synchronization of these goroutines is typically done using CHANNELS, which provide a way for goroutines to exchange data and coordinate their execution
*/

// Parallelism execution of a program by allowing multiple parts of the program to run in parallel on different processors.
/*goroutines can  be used to achieve parallelism */
